# TradingCompanion
The decription here will be updated along with the code to give an accurate description of the actual tool.

## Plan
I want this trading companion to be the tool you need for your trading career. At least, in the beginning, it will be especially Cryptocurrencies oriented. For this I want to create it in modules, so that in the end all modules work together as a complete app.

## Features
### Modules
#### Trade logger

#### Alerts
- Create an alert
- Recurring alerts
- System send you an alert with desired delay
- Email alert
- Push alert
#### Capital manager
- Manage your capital
- Integration with Trade logger Module
#### Setup VET
- Similar to Trade logger Module but setup oriented
- Statistics on setup
